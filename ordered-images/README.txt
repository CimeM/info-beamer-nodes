Ordered Image Player

Put your images into this directory. They should be named like 
presentation1.jpg, presentation2.jpg, ..., presentation13.png 
and so on. info-beamer will pick up these images and play them
in numeric order. 

The delay between images can be changed in node.lua. Search 
for TIME_PER_IMAGE.
