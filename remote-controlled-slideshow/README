A simple remote controlled slide show
=====================================

1) Start info-beamer with this directory:

    $ info-beamer .

2) Put the images you want to display into this 
   directory. You also delete or add images later.

   Maximum image size is 2048x2048 pixel. Both
   JPEG and PNG are supported.

3a) Open a TCP connection to the running info-beamer
    program:

    telnet localhost 4444

4a) Send "slideshow". This will bind your TCP connection
    to the running slideshow code. You'll see an "ok!"
    response from info-beamer.

5a) Send JSON formatted commands to start showing your
    images:

    {"filename": "image.jpg", "transition": "flip", "duration": 1}

    info-beamer will start the transition specified and switch to
    the image specified by 'filename'.

Or:

 3b) Send commands in the following format to the running info-beamer
     program using UDP:

     slideshow:{"filename": "image.jpg", "transition": "flip", "duration": 1}

You can control the running info-beamer using a simple echo command and netcat:

$ echo -en 'slideshow\n{"filename": "image.jpg", "transition": "blend1"}\n' | netcat localhost 4444

Or using UDP:

$ echo -en 'slideshow:{"filename": "image.jpg", "transition": "blend1"}' | netcat localhost 4444 -u

For a list of available transitions, see the node.lua source code. 
You should probably also change the resolution in the gl.setup line
inside node.lua to match your native resolution of your display.
