A simple remote controlled slide show
=====================================

1) Start info-beamer with this directory:

    $ info-beamer .

2) Put the images you want to display into this 
   directory. You also delete or add images later.

3) Open a TCP connection to the running info-beamer
   program:

   telnet localhost 4444

4) Send "slideshow". This will bind your TCP connection
   to the running slideshow code. You'll see an "ok!"
   response from info-beamer.

5) Send JSON formatted commands to start showing your
   images:

   {"filename": "image.jpg", "transition": "flip", "duration": 1}

   info-beamer will start the transition specified and switch to
   the image specified by 'filename'.


You can also control the running info-beamer using a simple 
echo command and netcat:

$ echo -en 'slideshow\n{"filename": "image.jpg", "transition": "blend1"}\n' | netcat localhost 4444

For a list of available transitions, see the node.lua source code.
