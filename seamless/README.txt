How to seamlessly play videos/images
====================================

Copy images (jpg, png) into this directory and
rename them so their filenames start with img_

You can also add videos (h264 mp4 only). Make
sure to rename them, so their filenames start
with vid_

A directory might look like this:

  vid_01_intro.mp4
  img_02_screen1.jpg
  img_03_screen2.jpg
  vid_04_outro.mp4

All files are played in the order set by their
filename with the vid_/img_ prefix removed.

The two video file examples in this directory
are taken from the Spectre trailer.
